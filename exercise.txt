Create an interface called Account. Three methods inside the interface:
1. depositAmount(double amt)
2. withdrawAmount(double amt)
3. showBalance(int accountNumber)

Create 2 classes - SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount which implement the Account interface.

Please accept the customername and the account number with an initial balance from the user. Make this a menu based program. Create an array of accounts (separate for savings and current - 5 elements each)
