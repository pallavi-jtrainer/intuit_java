Thread Synchronization:
1. Inter - thread communication
wait()
notify()
notifyAll()

These methods belong to the Object class


2. mutual exclusive :- ensures that threads do not interfere with each other when sharing a resource.
   a. synchronized method
   b. synchronized block
   c. static synchronization

DeadLock -> a situation that occurs when 2 threads share the same resource

Avoid deadlocks by:
1. Use Thread.join()
2. Avoid nested Locks and nested code
3. avoid unnecessary locks and access
